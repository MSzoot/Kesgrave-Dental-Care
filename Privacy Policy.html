                    If you experience a dental emergency, it's best to seek care
                    immediately. Dental issues can worsen rapidly, so don't
                    delay. If in doubt, contact your dentist or an emergency
                    dental clinic for guidance. For instance, if a tooth is
                    knocked out, try to re-implant it within the hour for the
                    best chance of success.

                  <p>
                    In preparation for an emergency dental visit, gather any
                    relevant dental records and insurance information if
                    available. Be sure to have a list of your current
                    medications and allergies. In case of trauma or injury, it's
                    helpful to keep an emergency dental kit with items like
                    gauze, a small container for a knocked-out tooth, and the
                    dentist's contact information handy.
