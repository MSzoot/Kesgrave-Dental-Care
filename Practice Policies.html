          Why do we need to keep this information?

          We need to keep records of personal information regarding our patients
          in order to provide safe and appropriate dental care and treatment. It
          is also used to maintain accurate treatment records.

          care under NHS arrangements and to ensure the proper management and
          administration of the NHS.

          What do we do with your Information?

        </p>
        <p>
          Your personal information may be securely shared with other healthcare
          professionals who need to be involved in your care (for example if we
          refer you to a specialist, need laboratory work undertaken or need to
          consult with your doctor).
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also share your personal information securely to third parties

          overriding public interest, for example, to help manage the COVID-19
          pandemic.

          </li>

          <li>
            There are several other documents that we may collect that have a
            variety of retention dates, for example, the NHS PR form – used to
            declare payment exemptions – which needs to be kept for a minimum of
            2 years. We have a retention schedule listing all documents and the
            timeframes for disposal. Retention periods may be changed from time
            to time based on business or legal and regulatory requirements.

        <p>
          At our practice, we understand that life is unpredictable and
          schedules can change. Our Missed Appointment Policy is designed with
          both fairness and compassion in mind, ensuring that we can continue to

          Cancellations and Rescheduling
        </h5>
        <p>
          We kindly ask that if you need to cancel or reschedule your
          appointment, please provide us with at least 24 hours' notice. This
          allows us to reallocate your slot to another patient in need of our
          care. For appointments exceeding 60 minutes, we appreciate as much
          notice as possible, ideally 48 hours.

          Missed Appointments
        </h5>
        <p>
          A missed appointment is considered as any instance where a patient
          does not attend their scheduled appointment without providing at least
          24 hours' notice. Missed appointments hinder our ability to provide
          care to other patients who could benefit from our services. There is a
          fee of £1 per minute of the missed appointment.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            New patients who do not attend their first appointment will
            regrettably not be offered a subsequent appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Existing patients who miss two appointments within a year may be
            unable to book further treatments or appointments.

          cannot be sorted out this way and you wish to make a complaint, we
          will respond to your complaint within three working days, enabling us
          to establish what happened more easily. If it is not possible to do
          that, please let us have details of your complaint within 12 months of
          the incident that caused the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complaints should be addressed to Dr Emma Grant - Complaints Manager,
          or Sunkanmi Olaore – Deputy Complaints Manager. You may ask for an
          appointment in order to discuss your concerns. We will explain the
          complaints procedure to you and will ensure that your concerns are
          dealt with promptly. It will be a great help if you are as specific as
          possible about your complaint.

          investigate your complaint, we shall aim to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Find out what happened and what went wrong</li>
          <li>
